ASL Project:

This repo includes the code from UVM CS228 Human Computer Interaction Code.  Using the leap motion device, some JavaScript, and a Machine learning algorithm, I personalized my project to be a ASL learning game for children.  The user is given images of the hand signs for numbers 0-10, then asked to sign them over the leap motion device.  Using a machine learning trained data set, the program gives points for properly signed numbers.
